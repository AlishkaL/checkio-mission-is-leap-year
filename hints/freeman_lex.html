            Catch an idea üí°! You just need to to write a few conditions to express the following rule. The year is leap, when it's divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 or divisible by 400.

        Ok, what should I start from?

        <p>
            Read about <a target="_blank" href="https://realpython.com/python-modulo-operator/">modulo (%)</a> operator and use it. Let's write the first condition: if the given year is NOT divisible by 4 (the remainder from modulo division is not equal 0) your function may immediately return <b class="code">False</b>, because it is not a leap year.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
if year % 4 != 0: return False
        </pre>

        What to do next?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            If a given year passes the first condition, check in the same way if it's divisible by 100. If not, that's what you need and your function may return <b class="code">True</b>.  
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
if year % 100 != 0: return True
        </pre>

        I still need a hint.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            If it's divisible by 100, the last chance to get a leap year is if it's divisible by 400. Your function must return the result if this comparison.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
return year % 400 == 0
        </pre>

        So, how my final solution should look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            You just need to join all previous hints and wrap your code into function expression. Using type hints for input and output data are highly recommended.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the whole solution:</p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: python">
def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:

    if year % 4 != 0: return False
    if year % 100 != 0: return True
    return year % 400 == 0

            Use a dedicated function from built-in module.
        </p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: python">
from calendar import isleap as is_leap_year
        </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            Check if the 29 of February is a correct date in this year. Notice, that you don't need to assign result of <b class="code">datetime</b> function to any variable.
        </p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: python">
from datetime import datetime


def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:
    
    try:
        datetime(year, 2, 29)
        return True
    except ValueError:
